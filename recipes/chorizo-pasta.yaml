steps:
  - Place the stock in a pot on medium-high heat or warm up in the microwave
  - "Chop the broccoli into pieces, thinly slice the garlic, dice the cherry peppers."
  - "Set a wok or saucier over medium-high heat, add a small drizzle of olive oil, and add the sausage removed from the casing. Break apart with a potato masher and cook until done then transfer to a bowl, keep as much fat in the pan as you can."
  - "Add the garlic and diced peppers, saute for 30 seconds. Add the broccoli with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 minutes stirring occasionally. Remove and add to the same bowl as the sausage."
  - "Pour in a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan. Add the dried pasta to the wok along with just enough chicken stock to cover the pasta. It should come to a boil very quickly. Cook the pasta until al dente and add more stock as needed if it reduces too fast before the pasta is done. At the end, the pasta should be cooked through and the stock should be significantly reduced into a sauce-like consistency."
  - "Turn the heat off and add the parm reg. Stir in until the sauce comes together. To thicken it can be cooked down more or optionally, use a corn starch slurry."
  - "Once thickened to your liking, add the sausage and broccoli mixture and stir to combine. Serve immediately with more parm reg over the top."
