steps:
  - "Add all ingredients, except for sausage and rice to the Instant Pot."
  - "Place the lid on, lock it, and set to manual high pressure for 28 minutes."
  - "At the end of the 28 minutes, use the quick release method (release the valve)."
  - "When the Instant Pot is fully depressurized the pin will fall, and you can remove the lid."
  - "Run the lid under cold water, and set aside. This will help the Instant Pot to re-seal."
  - "Add the chicken andouille sausage, place the lid on and lock it."
  - "Use the manual setting at 15 minutes high pressure, and allow the Instant Pot to release naturally this time (no using the pressure release valve, just let it sit until the pin drops). Mine took about 26 minutes to naturally release, FYI."
  - You can let the beans mixture sit with the lid of for a few minutes to thicken the liquid.
  - Serve the bean mixture over a cup of cooked rice.
